* All the .rakes need to become .rb as Xing::Tasklibs
* Above converted .rb files needs specs
* optionally need specs for ChildManager (or add requirement for tmux)
* need a xing-root tasklib that orchestrates the other tasklibs
* need docs on how to install and start using this sucker
* possibly code generation ie `rails new`, or `rails g` as a starting place for a xing project
